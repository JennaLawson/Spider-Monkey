# Spider-Monkey

contains processed data (processed data.csv and detection history.csv) that was compiled from raw acoustic data (1000's of audio detections of the spider monkey call in 60,000 1 minute audio files) and environmental data extracted from GIS files in ArcMap. Three scripts can be used to run occupancy analysis, binomial GLM's and create the figures.
